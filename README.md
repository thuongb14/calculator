## Summary
The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a functioning calculator using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
[Link to the Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

The calculator has basic functions, able to do basic math: add, substract, multiply, divide and is able to take not only integer but float number also by taking in decimal point.

I made use of CSS grid to make the calculator UI.
